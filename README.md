# 🌸 Iris Dataset - Machine Learning Classification with Decision Tree

This project demonstrates a simple and effective machine learning classification model using the **Decision Tree algorithm** on the famous **Iris flower dataset**. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
